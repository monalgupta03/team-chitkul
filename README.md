EthMumbai Project

We are developing a blockchain-based decentralized platform aimed at verifying the profiles of employees via employers and organizations without any third-party involvement. This initiative seeks to counteract the rising number of scams occurring on platforms like LinkedIn and to streamline the often time-consuming process of background checks. Our goal is to enhance the integrity and efficiency of professional networking and hiring processes. We will be issuing Soul Bound Tokens(SBTs) to employees from the MultiSig Wallet of employers such that there is more than one person from their team verifying your credentials. This process ensures a completely verified profile of an employee making the hiring and recruiting process seamless and hassle-free. Our goal is to enhance the integrity and efficiency of professional networking and hiring processes.

Flow:
-The signup page/dist/index.html opens up to signup page
-Signup requires details as well as connect wallet.
-The Connect wallet button redirects to metamask wallet page (if unavailable) or to the connect wallet (if available)
-After connecting wallet it leads to a sign up botton which opens up the user dashboard.
-User dashboard contains user details, SBTs applied/issued, job offers and network.
-Similarly the employer profile/dist/index.html leads to the employer dashboard where the company details, SBT requests and HRs with account access is visible.
